# homecad

[CadQuery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery) scripts I wrote for 3D printing at my home.

I know very very little about CAD or CadQuery, or 3D printing. Those scripts are in poor code quality. Experts can probably implement them much more elegantly.

Corner connector for curtain tracks
</summary>

The stock connector of the [curtain track](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BB1PS5NW) has a smaller radius (7cm) that is not smooth enough for automation (SwitchBot). I need a larger one.

Requires drilling and M2.5 screws to fix the connector to the metal tracks.

Deadbolt sensor - Magnet holder
</summary>

Similar to [this "Invisible Zigbee Deadbolt Sensor" project](https://www.instructables.com/Invisible-Zigbee-Deadbolt-Sensor/).

I use [10x5x2mm magnets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B6PBXBVJ). This is the holder for the magnets. It fixes the magnet to the 5x5mm lock cylinder.

Deadbolt sensor - Contact sensor holder
</summary>

Similar to [this "Invisible Zigbee Deadbolt Sensor" project](https://www.instructables.com/Invisible-Zigbee-Deadbolt-Sensor/).

I use [a smaller Zigbee contact sensor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPX7874R). This is the holder for the contact sensor. In my case, there is no need for wiring or soldering. I only need to remove the shell of the device.

Polish KW1 keys for print
</summary>

Polish KW1 models generated by [keygen](https://github.com/ervanalb/keygen) so they can be printed and actually used.

More specifically,
- Cut it thinner to avoid overhang and size mismatch.
- Deepen the slot to avoid mismatch.

To generate `a.stl` for a KW1 key:

```
keygen scad/kwikset.scad --bitting 12345
```

CadQuery cannot import `.stl`. So `.stl` needs to be converted to `.step` first. To convert `.stl` to `.step` using FreeCAD:
- Open the `.stl` file.
- Switch to "Part" workspace.
- Part -> Create shape from mesh.
- Part -> Convert to solid.
- File -> Export.

The example `k1a` and `k1b` use bitting 12345 and 76543.
